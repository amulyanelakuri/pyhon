12.2.3. Operator Precedence
Write a program to understand The operators precedence. Calculate the following expressions and print the result.
 Calculate a + b * 5
 Calculate a + b * 6 / 2
Sample Input and Output:
a: 20
b: 10
20 + 10 * 5 = 70
20 + 10 * 6 / 2 = 50.0


a=int(input("a: "))
b=int(input("b: "))
print(a,"+",b,"* 5","=",a+b*5)
print(a,"+",b,"* 6 / 2","=",a+b*6/2)


12.2.4. Writing an example on operator precedence

Write a simple program that demonstrates operator precedence. Take two integers a and b as input from the console using input() function.

Calculate the following expressions:
a + b * 5
a + b * 5 * 10 / 2
Print to the console, the result of the two input integers after performing these operations as shown in the example.

Sample Input and Output:
a: 32
b: 41
32 + 41 * 5 = 237
32 + 41 * 5 * 10 / 2 = 1057.0


a=int(input("a: "))
b=int(input("b: "))
c=a+b*5
d=a+b*5*10/2
print(a,"+",b,"* 5","=",c)
print(a,"+",b,"* 5 * 10 / 2","=",d)


12.2.5. Using operator precedence on Logical operators
02:36





Write a simple program that takes three input parameters a, b and c from the user and perform the following operations a and b or c , a or b and c then print the result.

Logical and is always calculated before Logical or.

Sample Input and Output:
a: 2
b: 0
c: 3
a and b or c 3
a or b and c 2


# Take input for variable a
a=int(input("a: "))

# Take input for variable b
b=int(input("b: "))

# Take input for variable c
c=int(input("c: "))

# calculate a and b or c and print the result
print('a and b or c',a and b or c)

# calculate a or b and c and print the resul


12.2.6. Using Operator Precedence on Logical Operators
02:53





Take three integers a, b and c as input from the console using input() function.

Calculate the following expressions:
a and b and c or a
a or b and c and a
For each expression, print to the console, the result of the three input integers as shown in the example.

Sample Input and Output:
a: 30
b: 2
c: 5
30 and 2 and 5 or 30 is 5
30 or 2 and 5 and 30 is 30


a=int(input("a: "))
b=int(input("b: "))
c=int(input("c: "))
print(a,"and",b,"and",c,"or",a,"is",a and b and c or a)
print(a,"or",b,"and",c,"and",a,"is",a or b and c and a)

print('a or b and c',a or b and c)
